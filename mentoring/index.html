<a id="slink" class="anchor" href="#volunteer" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Overview</h2>  
<p>There is no question that computer science has a gender problem: women account for less than 20% of CS BA/BS recipients, and hold an even smaller proportion of graduate degrees (<a href="https://ngcproject.org/statistics">source</a>). I believe that the solution to this problem is two-fold: mentorship and visibility. Seeing female computer scientists, and especially being taught and mentored by them, was incredibly important to my educational path. I hope to play a similar role to girls and young women in my community. 

  Since I have begun my studies at Northwestern, I have been active with two organizations whose goals align with my own in this regard:  <a href="http://www.sheiscode.com">She Is Code</a>, an organization in Evanston, IL, and Northwestern University's <a href="http://eecs.northwestern.edu/wic/">Women in Computing.</a> </p>

    <h2><a id="slink" class="anchor" href="#sheiscode" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>She Is Code</h2>  
  <p> She Is Code offers girls (ages 9-17) in the Evanston, IL community a chance to learn about technology. As a volunteer instructor, I work with the executive director to develop and present curriculum for one-off events and longer, ongoing sessions. During the summer of 2016, we are hosting Code the Hood, a long-term project in which our students learn website design, html basics, and brand management, and put their new skills to action by creating websites for local businesses.</p>

    <h2><a id="slink" class="anchor" href="#wic" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Women In Computing</h2>
  <p> Women in Computing is a peer-run organization and community for Northwestern undergraduate students. Under this umbrella, I founded a mentorship program between women in the computer science department. Undergraduate and first year graduate students are matched with a student mentor who is further along in her CS career. After a successful pilot program in the spring of 2016, the program will be expanding starting in the fall. </p>
