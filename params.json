{"name":"Irina Rabkina","tagline":"","body":"## About Me\r\nHello, and welcome to my page! I am a recent graduate of Scripps College (BA, Neuroscience 2014), a soon-to-be graduate of Loyola University Chicago (MS, Computer Science 2015), and a soon-to-be student of Northwestern University (PhD, Computer Science). As a researcher, my interest is at the intersection of how our knowledge about the brain can inform computation (i.e. Artificial Intelligence) and how computation can inform our knowledge about the brain (i.e. Neural/Cognitive Modeling). As an academic, my interest is in making computer science education more approachable, especially to girls and women. As a Californian transplanted to Chiberia, my interest is in finding warmth in the winter, dry air (and a microbrew) in the summer, and some mountains in between.\r\n\r\n## About This Page\r\nThis page will mainly reflect my academic and research interests. Look for [links and musings](/links) related to the flurry of AI research currently getting press (self-driving cars, anyone?), information about my own [research](/research), as well as [educational materials](/edu). If you'd like to get started with coding and/or Python, check out my Python [tutorial](/edu/python).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
