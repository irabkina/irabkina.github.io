<p>Hello, and welcome to my page! I am a recent graduate of Scripps College (BA, Neuroscience 2014), a soon-to-be graduate of Loyola University Chicago (MS, Computer Science 2015), and a soon-to-be student of Northwestern University (PhD, Computer Science). As a researcher, my interest is at the intersection of how our knowledge about the brain can inform computation (i.e. Artificial Intelligence) and how computation can inform our knowledge about the brain (i.e. Neural/Cognitive Modeling). As an academic, my interest is in making computer science education more approachable, especially to girls and women. As a Californian transplanted to Chiberia, my interest is in finding warmth in the winter, dry air (and a microbrew) in the summer, and some mountains in between.</p>

<p>This page will mainly reflect my academic and research interests. Look for <a href="/links">links and musings</a> related to the flurry of AI research currently getting press (self-driving cars, anyone?), information about my own <a href="/research">research</a>, as well as <a href="/edu">educational materials</a>. If you'd like to get started with coding and/or Python, check out my Python <a href="/edu/python">tutorial</a>.</p>
